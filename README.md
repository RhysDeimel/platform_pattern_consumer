# Platform Pattern - Consumer
This repo demonstrates how platform team produced modules might be consumed. The repository is using a generic "platform" pattern, where the folder and file structure represents the AWS hierarchy. To see a generic "application" pattern, please look at [this](https://github.com/RhysDeimel/terraform_stuctures) repository.


Linked to this is the [platform_pattern_producer](https://github.com/RhysDeimel/platform_pattern_producer) repository, where modules are produced.
